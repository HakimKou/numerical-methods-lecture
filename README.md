# Numerical Methods Lecture

This repository contains the material created during the lecture *Numerical Methods for Mathematical Finance* (Summer 2021).

In addition it contains code used in the exercise, e.g. interfaces which are to be implemented.

## Computer Arithmetic

### Assignments

We provide small coding assignments related to the lecture. The task is described in the README.md of the corresponding repository. Each repository contains a Maven project including unit test that will perform an "Autograding" of the assignment.
