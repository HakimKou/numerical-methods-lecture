# Numerical Methods Lecture

This repository contains the material created during the lecture *Numerical Methods for Mathematical Finance* (Summer 2023).

In addition it contains code used in the exercise, e.g. interfaces which are to be implemented.

In the following in incomplete list of code used in the different chapters of the lecture.


## Computer Arithmetic

### Sessions

info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.computerarithmetics

- IntegerArithmeticExperiment
- FloatingPointArithmeticExperiment
- SummationExperiment

### Assignments

We provide small coding assignments related to the lecture. The task is described in the README.md of the corresponding repository. Each repository contains a Maven project including unit test that will perform an "Autograding" of the assignment.

#### Loss of Significance (quadratic equation)

#### Summation (Kahan summation)

## Monte-Carlo Simulation

### Sessions

#### Introduction

The graph from the motivation session is generated by the class RunningAverageOfIndicator

```
net.finmath.lecture.numericalmethods.montecarlo.RunningAverageOfIndicator
```

#### Generating Vectors from Sequences

An example plotting 2D samples from 1D sequence:

```
info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.randomnumbers.plots.RandomVectorPlot
```

## Monte-Carlo Integration

### Sessions

In the session on Monte-Carlo integration a one-dimensional integrator is implemented, using the
a) Monte-Carlo integration and b) the Simpson's rule.

The implementation can be found in the package

```
info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.montecarlo.integration1d
```


The integrators are then tested in a unit test (so this time, there is no "Experiment" with a main() method). The tests can be found in src/test/java in the package

```
info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.montecarlo.integration1d
```

#### Java Streams

The code of the excursus on Java streams can be found in 

```
info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.streams.JavaStreamsExperiments
```

### Assignments

The interfaces related to the coding assignments for implementing a general integrator are in the package

```
info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.montecarlo.integration
```

- `Integrand`
- `IntegrationDomain`
- `Integrator`
- `Monte-CarloIntegratorFactory`
